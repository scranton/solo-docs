Gloo can be installed in several different ways. The most common, and customizable, way to deploy Gloo is to
install on Kubernetes **[using the published helm chart](install_with_helm)**. For a faster introduction,
follow the **[open source quick start guide](quick_start)**. And Gloo can be run standalone using
**[Docker](docker-compose)**.

## Running on Kubernetes
