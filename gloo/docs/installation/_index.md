Gloo can be installed in several different ways. The most common, and customizable, way to deploy Gloo is to
install on Kubernetes [using the published helm chart](install_with_helm). For a faster introduction,
follow the [open source quick start guide](quick_start). And Gloo can be run standalone using
[Docker](docker-compose).
